REACHABILITY_ANALYSIS_BLOCK = """

                    REACHABILITY ANALYSIS - CRITICAL FOR SCENARIO QUALITY:

                    Before finalizing your scenario, verify reachability - that both
                    victory and defeat are achievable from every reachable game state.

                    A scenario is BROKEN if:
                    1. The player cannot win (no path to victory exists)
                    2. The player cannot lose (no challenge, no defeat path)
                    3. The player can reach a state where victory becomes permanently
                       impossible, regardless of skill

                    THE FOUR WAYS SCENARIOS BREAK:

                    1. RESOURCE DEAD END: The total resources on the map (mines + starting
                       stockpile) are insufficient to accomplish the victory condition, and
                       no alternative income sources (market, trade route, relics) are
                       provided. Ensure the player has enough total resources to build the
                       units and structures needed to win.

                    2. COMPOSITION IMBALANCE: The enemy has a unit composition that the
                       player has no effective counter for, given the units and buildings
                       available to them. For example, giving the enemy massed bombard
                       cannons but only providing the player with infantry and no siege
                       workshop or ranged units. Ensure the player has access to units or
                       buildings that can counter every enemy unit type present.

                    3. POSITIONAL TRAP: The player cannot physically reach objectives or
                       enemies. For example, objectives placed across water with no dock
                       or transport ship provided, or enemies behind terrain barriers with
                       no siege units available. Ensure physical paths exist or provide the
                       tools to create them.

                    4. TIMING COLLAPSE: The gap between the first enemy threat and the
                       player's first possible military response is too large, and the
                       player's existing assets cannot survive that gap. The enemy destroys
                       win-critical assets (town center, hero unit, key buildings) before
                       the player can mount any defense. Ensure the player has enough
                       starting units or defenses to survive until they can respond.

                    TRIGGER CONDITIONS FOR WIN/LOSE - PREFER destroy_object OVER objects_in_area:
                    - For any VICTORY or DEFEAT condition, prefer destroy_object on a stored
                      unit reference (enemy leader, castle, hero, or a key building) over
                      objects_in_area(quantity=0, ...).
                    - objects_in_area(quantity=0) is a FRAGILE win/lose check: a single enemy
                      unit that garrisons inside a building, gets converted, flees to an
                      unreachable corner, or spawns outside the checked area leaves the count
                      above 0 forever - making victory permanently unreachable (failure mode
                      3, POSITIONAL TRAP). destroy_object targets one specific object by its
                      reference_id and fires deterministically when that object dies.
                    - CORRECT (deterministic): store the reference and destroy it -
                        enemy_leader = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.TWO, unit_const=HeroInfo.XXX.ID, ...)
                        vc = trigger_manager.add_trigger("VC")
                        vc.new_condition.destroy_object(unit_object=enemy_leader.reference_id)
                        vc.new_effect.declare_victory(source_player=PlayerId.ONE, enabled=1)
                    - Reserve objects_in_area for NON-TERMINAL detection (is the player near a
                      zone, has a wave been thinned) - not as the sole path to victory. If you
                      must gate victory on clearing an area, ALSO provide a destroy_object
                      victory path on the enemy leader/castle so the scenario is still winnable.
                    - Every scenario MUST contain at least one declare_victory effect reachable
                      through a destroy_object (or bring_object_to_area) condition.

                    REACHABILITY CHECKLIST (verify before generating code):
                    - [ ] Victory trigger exists and is reachable through player actions
                    - [ ] Victory is driven by destroy_object / bring_object_to_area, not by a
                          lone objects_in_area(quantity=0) check
                    - [ ] Defeat is possible (enemy can actually threaten the player)
                    - [ ] Total resources on the map are sufficient to reach the victory
                          condition
                    - [ ] Player has access to units that can counter the enemy composition
                    - [ ] Player can physically reach all objectives on the map
                    - [ ] If timed waves exist, the player has enough starting
                          units/buildings to survive the first wave
                    - [ ] No trigger deadlocks (triggers that disable each other creating
                          an unwinnable state)

                    After verifying, add a comment block at the top of your generated code:

FIDELITY_RUBRIC_BLOCK = """

                    HISTORICAL FIDELITY - THE SCENARIO MUST DEPICT THE REAL EPISODE:

                    You are dramatising a specific historical event, not producing a
                    generic medieval battle with the event's name attached. A player who
                    finishes this scenario should come away knowing things that are true
                    about THIS episode. Work through the five requirements below before
                    you write any code.

                    1. COMBATANTS - THE RIGHT SIDES, UNDER THE RIGHT PEOPLE:
                       - Identify who actually fought. Name both sides in the scenario
                         text using the names used at the time or by historians, not
                         approximations ("Umayyad Caliphate", not "the Muslims"; "Kingdom
                         of the Franks", not "the Europeans").
                       - The commanders present must be the commanders who were there.
                         Charles Martel at Tours, Mehmed II at Constantinople, Harold
                         Godwinson and William at Hastings. Do NOT substitute a famous
                         hero from the wrong century or the wrong theatre because a
                         HeroInfo constant with that name happens to exist.
                       - If the parser has no hero constant for the real commander, use a
                         plain unit of the right type and NAME it correctly in the trigger
                         text and objectives. A correctly named generic unit is far better
                         than a famous hero who was not present.
                       - Player 1 should be the side the brief puts the player on, and the
                         enemy player should be that side's actual opponent.

                    2. MATERIAL - PLAUSIBLE FOR THIS PLACE AND THIS DECADE:
                       - Choose units that side actually fielded. Steppe armies are horse
                         archers and light cavalry, not massed halberdiers. Frankish armies
                         are heavy infantry and cavalry, not elephants. Byzantine defence
                         rests on walls and cataphracts.
                       - Choose buildings and defences of the right kind and scale: a city
                         under siege needs walls, towers and gates; a field battle needs
                         camps, not castles.
                       - Choose terrain that matches the real geography - rivers, coasts,
                         mountains, desert, steppe - and place the armies on it the way
                         they were really deployed (besiegers outside the walls, defenders
                         within; the crossing on the correct bank).
                       - Numbers should reflect the real balance of force. If one side was
                         heavily outnumbered, show that in the unit counts.

                    3. EVENTS - REPRODUCE THE REAL TURNING POINTS, INVENT NOTHING:
                       - Build the scenario around what actually decided the episode: the
                         breach of a specific wall, a feigned retreat, the arrival or
                         failure of relief, a commander's death, a river crossing.
                       - Sequence those beats in the order they really happened, and drive
                         them with triggers so the player lives through them.
                       - Do NOT invent dramatic events that did not occur, and do NOT
                         relocate real events to this episode from another one.
                       - Where the outcome is known, the winnable path should be the one
                         that side really took. A counterfactual is acceptable ONLY if the
                         scenario text says plainly that it is one.

                    4. ANACHRONISM - NOTHING FROM THE WRONG PERIOD:
                       - Every unit, building, technology and piece of text must be
                         possible in the year of the episode. No gunpowder before it
                         existed in that theatre; no bombard cannon at an 8th-century
                         battle; no stone castles centuries before they were built there.
                       - Titles, place names and forms of address must be the ones in use
                         then - the city is Constantinople, not Istanbul, in 1453.
                       - When you are unsure whether something existed yet, leave it out.

                    5. PEDAGOGY - WHAT THE PLAYTHROUGH TEACHES MUST BE TRUE:
                       - Use display_instructions text to state the date, the place, the
                         stakes, and who the player is, in concrete terms.
                       - Objectives should teach the real strategic problem that side
                         faced, not a generic "destroy the enemy".
                       - Dialogue and narration should carry specifics a curious player
                         could check: years, titles, place names, the reason the campaign
                         was fought.
                       - Avoid empty colour. One accurate sentence about why this battle
                         mattered beats a paragraph of invented speeches.

                    After working through these, add a comment block at the top of your
                    generated code:

# Appended to the system prompt when ScenarioConfig.fidelity_prompt is True
# (default False, so this is opt-in and every prior run is unaffected). This is
# a SEPARATE lever from the v1 `fidelity_rubric` above, which is left exactly as
# it was: FIDELITY_RUBRIC_BLOCK is the instrument that produced the published
# rubric-arm scores, so rewording it would make the paper misdescribe what ran.
# New work should use this arm; the old one stays for reproducibility.
#
# The text itself lives in rubric_v2.py, which the judge also imports, so the
# instruction and the criterion cannot drift apart. It is pasted VERBATIM -
# including its column-0 indentation, which differs from the surrounding prompt -
# because a byte-identical match with the paper's rubric table is worth more
# than cosmetic alignment.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The v2 fidelity block asks for two operations the base prompt never teaches:
# assigning a civilization to each active player, and renaming a generic unit to
# a historical figure. In the first run of the arm the model knew WHAT to do and
# not HOW, and invented APIs for both - `datasets.civilizations`,
# `player_manager.get_player()`, `unit.name = ...`,
# `change_object_name(unit_object=...)`. None exist. The result was 0/8 first
# attempt builds and one episode that never built, against 8/8 first-attempt for
# the arm that made neither demand.
#
# So this block carries the API surface those two instructions require, and
# nothing else. Every name and signature below was executed against the
# installed parser and round-tripped from a written file before being written
# here - it states verified facts, not a better guess.
#
# It ships with the fidelity arm rather than in the shared base prompt on
# purpose: the base prompt is common to every arm, so editing it would change
# the conditions the 31 baseline scenarios were generated under and cost a
# baseline re-run. Attaching it here leaves that byte-identical, and makes the
# treatment "the fidelity instructions plus the API needed to obey them", which
# is one intervention rather than two.

API REQUIRED BY THE REQUIREMENTS ABOVE
Two of the requirements above need calls that appear nowhere else in this
prompt. Use exactly these forms; the alternatives listed as WRONG do not
exist in this library and will crash.

1. ASSIGNING A CIVILIZATION (the SETTING requirement)
   The Civilization enum lives in datasets.object_support, and players are
   indexed by player number on the player manager:

     from AoE2ScenarioParser.datasets.object_support import Civilization

     player_manager = scenario.player_manager
     player_manager.players[1].civilization = Civilization.FRANKS
     player_manager.players[2].civilization = Civilization.SARACENS

   players[1] is Player ONE, players[2] is Player TWO, and so on; players[0]
   is GAIA and is left alone. Set this for every active player.
   Members include: BRITONS, FRANKS, GOTHS, TEUTONS, JAPANESE, CHINESE,
   BYZANTINES, PERSIANS, SARACENS, TURKS, VIKINGS, MONGOLS, CELTS, SPANISH,
   AZTECS, MAYANS, HUNS, KOREANS, ITALIANS, INDIANS, INCAS, MAGYARS, SLAVS.
   WRONG: there is NO module `AoE2ScenarioParser.datasets.civilizations`, and
   NO `player_manager.get_player(...)` method.

2. RENAMING A UNIT TO A HISTORICAL FIGURE (the COMBATANTS requirement)
   A unit's name is not writable in Python; renaming is a trigger effect that
   targets the unit by its reference_id:

     martel = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.ONE, unit_const=UnitInfo.CHAMPION.ID,
                                    x=center, y=center)
     rename = trigger_manager.add_trigger("Name the commander")
     rename.new_condition.timer(timer=1)
     rename.new_effect.change_object_name(selected_object_ids=martel.reference_id,
                                          message="Charles Martel")

   WRONG: `unit.name = "..."` (the property has no setter), and
   `change_object_name(unit_object=...)` / `change_object_name(name=...)` -
   the parameters are `selected_object_ids` and `message`.

YOU decide the trigger structure and the number of triggers that best fit THIS
episode - there is NO fixed or required trigger count. As a soft minimum, create
enough triggers to cover: initial setup, the narrative/dialogue beats, the
objectives, and the win/loss conditions. Choose whatever design makes the
scenario the most historically faithful and the most playable for this episode."""

                    ALWAYS use from_default() to create new scenarios:
                    - scenario = AoE2DEScenario.from_default()
                    - Do NOT use from_file() as template files may not exist

                    CRITICAL RULES:
                    - Do NOT use scenario_metadata - it doesn't exist
                    - Always use .ID when adding units (e.g., UnitInfo.MILITIA.ID)
                    - Use unit_manager.add_unit() for units AND buildings
                    - Use PlayerId.ONE, PlayerId.TWO, PlayerId.GAIA for players
                    - For trigger conditions/effects, ALWAYS use source_player (NOT player)
                    - Do NOT use these methods: own_fewer_objects, victory(), own_objects with player param
                    - PLAYER RESOURCES: grant/set with new_effect.modify_resource(quantity=, tribute_list=Attribute.*_STORAGE, source_player=, operation=Operation.*). Do NOT use modify_attribute for this, and do NOT reference ResourceId/Resource - they do not exist in this parser.
                    - VARIABLE NAMING - NEVER shadow Python builtins! These cause cryptic crashes:
                      * NEVER use these as variable names: range, map, list, type, id, set, dict, min, max, sum, filter, input, open, print, len, int, str, float, bool, object, round, zip, next, iter, hash, tuple, bytes, super, enumerate, reversed, sorted, abs, pow
                      * WRONG: range = unit_manager.add_unit(...)  # Overwrites Python's range() - crashes ALL subsequent for-loops!
                      * WRONG: map = map_manager  # Overwrites Python's map() function!
                      * RIGHT: archer_range_bld = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.ONE, unit_const=BuildingInfo.ARCHERY_RANGE.ID, ...)
                      * RIGHT: patrol_range = 20
                      * Use descriptive names: firing_range, attack_range, bow_range, archer_range_bld, mountain_range_start
                    - TYPE ERRORS CAUSE CRASHES - Never pass strings where integers/enums are expected:
                      * WRONG: source_player="PlayerId.ONE" or source_player="1"
                      * RIGHT: source_player=PlayerId.ONE
                      * WRONG: unit_const="UnitInfo.MILITIA.ID" or unit_const="74"
                      * RIGHT: unit_const=UnitInfo.MILITIA.ID
                      * WRONG: x="50", y="50"
                      * RIGHT: x=50, y=50 (integers, not strings!)
                      * All coordinates (x, y, area_x1, area_y1, etc.) must be integers
                      * All player references must be PlayerId enums, not strings
                    - UNIT POSITION ACCESS: Units returned by add_unit() have .x and .y directly
                      * RIGHT: unit.x, unit.y
                      * WRONG: unit.position.x, unit.position.y (Unit has NO .position attribute!)
                    - CRITICAL: All units AND terrain tiles must be within map boundaries (0 to map_size-1)
                      * ALWAYS get map_size first: map_size = map_manager.map_size
                      * For a 120x120 map, valid coordinates are 0-119
                      * For an 80x80 map, valid coordinates are 0-79
                      * NEVER use hardcoded values like range(0, 80) - use range(0, map_size) instead
                      * Use map_size-relative calculations: map_size // 4, map_size // 2, etc.
                      * Units/tiles placed outside boundaries cause ValueError crash!
                    - CRITICAL: No two objects can share the same coordinates!
                      * Every unit, building, and GAIA object MUST have unique (x, y) coordinates
                      * Buildings are larger than 1 tile - leave space around them (2-4 tiles depending on size)
                      * When placing multiple units, offset each one: x+0, x+1, x+2 or use loops with different positions
                      * WRONG: placing 5 archers all at (50, 50)
                      * RIGHT: placing archers at (50,50), (51,50), (52,50), (50,51), (51,51)
                      * Use loops with offsets: for i in range(5): add_unit(..., x=base_x+i, y=base_y)
                    - CRITICAL: Never place units on top of impassable terrain or GAIA objects!
                      * Do NOT place units on WATER_DEEP, WATER_MEDIUM terrain (they will drown/be stuck)
                      * Do NOT place units where you placed trees, cliffs, mountains, or rocks
                      * Do NOT place units on top of GOLD_MINE, STONE_MINE, or other resources
                      * Plan your map layout FIRST: define zones for water, terrain features, resources, THEN place units in clear areas
                      * Leave buffer space (2-3 tiles) between terrain features and unit spawn points
                      * Example layout order: 1) Paint water/terrain 2) Place cliffs/trees 3) Place resources 4) Place units in remaining clear land
                    - MANDATORY: Every scenario MUST include GAIA resources for all human players:
                      * GOLD_MINE: At least 2 clusters of 4-5 mines near each player start
                      * STONE_MINE: At least 1 cluster of 3-4 mines near each player start
                      * FORAGE_BUSH or FRUIT_BUSH: At least 6-8 bushes near each player start
                      * Huntables (DEER, WILD_BOAR) or herdables (SHEEP, GOAT): 4-8 animals
                      * If water exists: SHORE_FISH along coastlines

                    - MANDATORY: Military buildings based on scenario type (see template for specifics):
                      * BATTLE scenarios: Both sides need production buildings near their bases
                        - Player: BARRACKS, ARCHERY_RANGE, STABLE (1-2 each), BLACKSMITH
                        - Enemy: BARRACKS, ARCHERY_RANGE, STABLE, CASTLE or GUARD_TOWERs
                      * DEFENSE scenarios: Defender has full base, attackers spawn from edges
                        - Defender: TOWN_CENTER, CASTLE, BARRACKS, ARCHERY_RANGE, STABLE, BLACKSMITH, UNIVERSITY
                        - Walls: 20+ STONE_WALL or PALISADE_WALL segments with GATE
                        - Towers: 4-6 GUARD_TOWER or KEEP at strategic positions
                      * ESCORT scenarios: Minimal buildings, focus on journey
                        - Enemy camps: BARRACKS or ARCHERY_RANGE at ambush points
                        - Friendly camps: TOWN_CENTER or PAVILION clusters for recruitment
                      * DIPLOMACY scenarios: Each faction has a distinct camp
                        - Faction camps: PAVILION_A/B/C, YURT_A-H, or TENT_A-E based on culture
                        - Military: 1-2 production buildings (STABLE for nomads, BARRACKS for settled)
                        - Decorations: BONFIRE, TORCH_A, FLAG_B/D for camp atmosphere
                      * CONQUEST scenarios: Enemy has layered fortifications
                        - Outer defenses: PALISADE_WALL, WATCH_TOWER
                        - Inner fortress: STONE_WALL, FORTIFIED_WALL, GATE, GUARD_TOWER, KEEP
                        - Core: CASTLE, TOWN_CENTER
                      * Building placement: Leave 3-4 tiles between buildings, place production buildings near unit rally points

                    - CRITICAL: WALLS AND GATES FOR AI PLAYERS
                      AI players can ONLY pass through gates they own. Follow these rules:
                      * GATE OWNERSHIP: Always assign gates to the player whose units need to pass through
                        - WRONG: Player ONE owns gate, but Player TWO units need to exit their base
                        - RIGHT: Player TWO owns gate for their own base, Player ONE owns gates for player base
                      * AI BASE DESIGN: Enemy AI bases with walls MUST have gates owned by that AI player
                        - Example: If Player TWO has a walled base, Player TWO must own the GATE
                        - unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.TWO, unit_const=BuildingInfo.GATE_NORTH_TO_SOUTH.ID, x=50, y=50)
                      * GATE TRIGGERS: Use triggers to control gate access at specific times:
                        - Store gate reference: gate = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.TWO, unit_const=BuildingInfo.GATE_NORTH_TO_SOUTH.ID, ...)
                        - Delete gate to "breach" walls: trigger.new_effect.remove_object(object_list_unit_id=gate.reference_id, source_player=PlayerId.TWO)
                        - Change ownership to capture: trigger.new_effect.change_ownership(area_x1=..., source_player=PlayerId.TWO, target_player=PlayerId.ONE)
                      * PATROL THROUGH GATES: Use patrol/attack-move to make AI units path through their own gates
                        - trigger.new_effect.patrol(unit_object=unit.reference_id, source_player=PlayerId.TWO, location_x=target_x, location_y=target_y)
                      * WALL GAPS FOR SCRIPTED EXITS: For enemy AI that needs to attack:
                        - Option 1: Leave intentional gaps in walls (no gate needed)
                        - Option 2: AI-owned gates at exit points
                        - Option 3: Trigger to delete wall/gate section when attack begins
                      * COMMON MISTAKE: Surrounding enemy base entirely with player-owned walls/gates = AI trapped forever
                      * DEFENSE SCENARIOS: Defender (Player ONE) owns gates in their walls; attackers spawn OUTSIDE walls

                    TRIGGER DESIGN - TIMERS VS AREA TRIGGERS:
                    - AVOID timer conditions for main objectives and story progression
                    - Players move at their own pace - timer-based objectives feel artificial
                    - Use bring_object_to_area for location-based events (arrival, discovery, ambush)
                    - Use destroy_object for combat milestones (enemy defeated, gate breached)
                    - Use objects_in_area to detect unit presence in zones
                    - ONLY use timers for:
                      * Opening narration (first 5-10 seconds)
                      * Ambient/flavor dialogue that doesn't affect gameplay
                      * Historical time pressure when part of the actual narrative (siege countdown, dawn attack)
                      * Defense scenario wave spawns (these ARE time-based by design)

                    TRIGGER STRUCTURE - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
                    *** YOU MUST CREATE THE EXACT NUMBER OF TRIGGERS SPECIFIED IN THE TEMPLATE ***
                    - The template specifies MINIMUM trigger counts for each section - MEET OR EXCEED THEM
                    - Scenarios with insufficient triggers are INCOMPLETE and will be REJECTED
                    - Count your triggers before finishing - if below the minimum, ADD MORE

                    Follow the detailed trigger counts and patterns in the scenario template provided.
                    Key rules:
                    - Store unit references: hero = unit_manager.add_unit(...), then use hero.reference_id in triggers
                    - Victory: declare_victory(source_player=PlayerId.ONE, enabled=1) for player win
                    - Defeat: declare_victory(source_player=PlayerId.TWO, enabled=1) to make enemy win = player loses
                    - Dialogue colors: <BLUE> allies, <RED> enemies, <YELLOW> narrator
                    - Naming: "[D0] Intro", "[D1] Scout", "[Obj] Objective 1", "VC", "Defeat"
                    - CREATE EVERY TRIGGER LISTED IN THE TEMPLATE - do not skip any

                    COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
                    - KING and QUEEN are in UnitInfo, NOT HeroInfo! Use UnitInfo.KING.ID
                    - difficulty_level only takes: quantity (0-4) and inverted (0/1). NO "compare" parameter!
                    - Use object_list_unit_id for effects, object_list for conditions
                    - All heroes use HeroInfo except: KING, QUEEN (UnitInfo), KHAN (both exist - use HeroInfo.KHAN for Genghis)

            ===== MANDATORY TRIGGER REQUIREMENTS =====
            YOU MUST CREATE EXACTLY 25-30 TRIGGERS. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.
            Scenarios with fewer than 25 triggers are INCOMPLETE and UNACCEPTABLE.

            Count your triggers as you create them. Do not stop until you have at least 25.

            REQUIRED TRIGGER BREAKDOWN (minimum counts - you MUST meet or exceed these):
            - Setup triggers: 4-5 MINIMUM (Techs, Walls, Easy Difficulty, Hardmode, Close Gates)
            - Dialogue triggers: 10-12 MINIMUM using "[D#] Name" pattern (numbered [D0] through [D11])
            - Objective triggers: 3-4 MINIMUM using "[Obj] Name" or "[O] Name" pattern
            - Victory/Defeat triggers: 3-4 MINIMUM (VC, VC2, Defeat, DEFEAT)
            - Special triggers: 2-3 MINIMUM (Resign player, unit behavior, reinforcements)
            ==========================================

            TRIGGER STRUCTURE (from Saladin cam3 - 28 triggers) - CREATE ALL OF THESE:
            1. --- Setup Section (CREATE ALL 5 triggers) ---
               YOU MUST CREATE ALL OF THESE SETUP TRIGGERS:
               - "Techs": timer(1), research_technology for 2-3 starting techs (FORGING, SCALE_MAIL, etc.)
               - "Walls": timer(1), setup initial wall/gate states
               - "Easy Difficulty": condition=difficulty_level(quantity=0), kill_object to reduce enemies
               - "Hardmode": condition=difficulty_level(quantity=3), create_object to spawn extra enemies
               - "Close Gates": timer(1), task_object to close all gates at scenario start

            2. --- Dialogue Section (CREATE ALL 12 triggers with "[D#]" prefix) ---
               YOU MUST CREATE ALL OF THESE DIALOGUE TRIGGERS:

               - "[D3] Enemy Taunt 1": timer(60), enemy leader boasts - "<RED>Enemy: [Taunt message]"
               - "[D4] Enemy Taunt 2": timer(120), second enemy taunt - "<RED>Enemy: [Second taunt]"
               - "[D5] At Location 1": bring_object_to_area, reach first key position
               - "[D6] At Location 2": bring_object_to_area, reach second key position
               - "[D7] Battle Begins": timer(180), major combat starts - "<YELLOW>Narrator: [Battle description]"
               - "[D8] Midpoint Update": timer(300), battle progress update
               - "[D9] Enemy Weakening": objects_in_area (enemy count low), enemy morale breaks

               - "[D11] Hero Falls": destroy_object on hero, death message before defeat trigger

            3. --- Objective Section (CREATE ALL 4 triggers with "[Obj]" prefix) ---
               YOU MUST CREATE ALL OF THESE OBJECTIVE TRIGGERS:
               - "[O] Main Objectives": timer(1), display ALL objectives at start
               - "[Obj] Primary Goal": main victory condition tracking
               - "[Obj] Secondary Goal": optional/bonus objective
               - "[Obj] Survival": hero must survive notification

            4. --- Victory/Defeat Section (CREATE ALL 4 triggers) ---
               YOU MUST CREATE ALL OF THESE VICTORY/DEFEAT TRIGGERS:
               - "VC": destroy enemy leader/castle, declare_victory(source_player=PlayerId.ONE, enabled=1)
               - "VC2": alternative victory (e.g., timer survival), declare_victory player 1
               - "Defeat": hero dies, declare_victory(source_player=PlayerId.TWO, enabled=1)

            - 15-25 military units in formation
            - Base buildings: TOWN_CENTER, 2-3 HOUSE, MILL, BLACKSMITH
            - Military production: BARRACKS, ARCHERY_RANGE, STABLE (1-2 each)
            - Place buildings in a cluster with 3-4 tile spacing
            - If player has walls: Player ONE owns their own gates

            Player TWO+ (Enemy AI):
            Store enemy leader reference!
            - enemy_leader = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.TWO, unit_const=HeroInfo.XXX.ID, ...)
            - 30-50 military units in defensive positions
            - Fortifications: CASTLE or 4-6 GUARD_TOWER/KEEP
            - Walls: 15-30 STONE_WALL segments with 1-2 GATE
            - Production: BARRACKS, ARCHERY_RANGE, STABLE behind walls
            - Support: TOWN_CENTER, BLACKSMITH, MONASTERY

            CRITICAL - ENEMY GATE OWNERSHIP:
            - ALL gates in enemy base owned by ENEMY (PlayerId.TWO)
            - enemy_gate = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.TWO, unit_const=BuildingInfo.GATE_NORTH_TO_SOUTH.ID, ...)
            - This allows enemy to patrol/sortie through their own gates
            - Player must destroy gates to breach enemy base

            GAIA:
            - 500+ trees forming forests/boundaries
            - Resources near player start
            - Decorations: ROMAN_RUINS, SKELETON, FLAG_A for atmosphere

            UNIT PLACEMENT:
            - Military units in formation groups (infantry front, archers behind)
            - Guard towers protecting key positions (corners, gates, hills)
            - Walls and gates around enemy bases (enemy-owned!)
            - Hero unit with 3-5 bodyguard units

            AI BEHAVIOR TRIGGERS:
            - "Enemy Patrol": timer(1), task_object for enemy patrols THROUGH THEIR GATES
            - "Enemy Sortie": objects_in_area (player near base), task enemy units to attack
            - "Gate Defense": enemy archers/towers positioned to defend gate approaches

            HISTORICAL BATTLEFIELD CONSTRUCTION (CRITICAL - build the location FIRST):
            Step 1: Define the battlefield geography using map_size-relative zones
               map_size = map_manager.map_size
               # Divide map into logical zones based on historical layout

            Step 2: Paint terrain to match historical geography
               - Rivers/water: WATER_DEEP, WATER_SHALLOW with BEACH transitions
               - Hills/ridges: Use elevation via CLIFF objects in lines
               - Forests: Dense TREE placement (100-300 trees) to block movement
               - Roads: ROAD terrain connecting key positions
               - Open fields: GRASS_1, GRASS_2 for battle areas

            Step 3: Add GAIA objects to define the battlefield
               - CLIFF_DEFAULT_2/3: Create ridges, hills, impassable terrain
               - ROCK_FORMATION_1/2: Rocky outcrops, defensive positions
               - Trees (TREE_OAK, TREE_A-F): Forest boundaries, flanking protection
               - Decorations: FLAGS for objectives, ROMAN_RUINS for atmosphere

            EXAMPLE - Battle of Hastings (1066):
               # Senlac Hill where Saxons defended
               hill_y = map_size // 3  # Hill in upper third
               # Create ridge with cliffs
               for x in range(quarter, three_quarter):
                   unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.GAIA, unit_const=OtherInfo.CLIFF_DEFAULT_2.ID, x=x, y=hill_y)
               # Saxon shield wall position ON the hill
               for i in range(15):
                   unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.TWO, unit_const=UnitInfo.MAN_AT_ARMS.ID, x=center-7+i, y=hill_y-3)
               # Norman starting position at bottom (open field)
               norman_y = three_quarter
               # Forests on flanks to prevent encirclement
               for x in range(0, quarter):
                   for y in range(hill_y-10, hill_y+10):
                       unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.GAIA, unit_const=OtherInfo.TREE_OAK.ID, x=x, y=y)

            EXAMPLE - Thermopylae (480 BC):
               # Sea on right side (east)
               for x in range(three_quarter, map_size):
                   for y in range(0, map_size):
                       tile = map_manager.get_tile(x=x, y=y)
                       tile.terrain_id = TerrainId.WATER_DEEP.value
               # Mountains on left (west) - dense cliffs
               for x in range(0, quarter):
                   for y in range(0, map_size):
                       unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.GAIA, unit_const=OtherInfo.CLIFF_DEFAULT_3.ID, x=x, y=y)
               # Narrow pass in middle (the Hot Gates) - only 8-10 tiles wide
               pass_width = 10
               pass_x_start = quarter
               pass_x_end = three_quarter
               # Greeks defend the narrowest point

            EXAMPLE - River Crossing Battle:
               # River running north-south through center
               river_x = center
               for y in range(0, map_size):
                   for dx in range(-2, 3):  # 5-tile wide river
                       tile = map_manager.get_tile(x=river_x+dx, y=y)
                       tile.terrain_id = TerrainId.WATER_SHALLOW.value
               # Ford/bridge at specific point
               bridge_y = center
               # Place BRIDGE objects or shallow crossing

            MANDATORY RESOURCES AND BOUNDARIES:
            - Place GAIA resources (gold, stone, forage, huntables) near player starting positions
            - ALWAYS get map_size = map_manager.map_size FIRST
            - All coordinates must be within 0 to map_size-1
            - Build terrain BEFORE placing units (so units aren't on water/cliffs)

            ===== FINAL TRIGGER CHECKLIST - VERIFY BEFORE FINISHING =====
            Count your triggers. You MUST have created AT LEAST:
            [ ] 5 Setup triggers (Techs, Walls, Easy Difficulty, Hardmode, Close Gates)
            [ ] 12 Dialogue triggers ([D0] through [D11])
            [ ] 4 Objective triggers ([O] Main, [Obj] Primary, Secondary, Survival)
            [ ] 4 Victory/Defeat triggers (VC, VC2, Defeat, DEFEAT)
            ---------------------------------------------------------

=== KEY DESIGN ELEMENTS ===
1. PURSUIT creates urgency (timer-spawned cavalry chasing from behind)
2. EARNED RECRUITMENT (kill raider chief to get allies)
3. JOURNEY BEATS (5 location-triggered story moments)
4. CLEAR VICTORY/DEFEAT (hero reaches destination or dies)

=== RULES ===
- Store hero, companion, enemy_gate, raider_chief references at creation
- Use bring_object_to_area for location triggers, NOT timers
- Enemy gates owned by PlayerId.TWO
- Spawn multiple units with loops, not quantity parameter""",

            - Enemy lord (store reference for triggers)
            - 30-50 military units in fortified base
            - Fortified base:

              * STONE_WALL perimeter with GATE (enemy owns gate!)
              * GUARD_TOWER at key positions
              * BARRACKS, STABLE, ARCHERY_RANGE
            - Patrols that move THROUGH their own gates

            Players THREE-EIGHT (Neutral Factions - AI):
            Each faction has a distinct camp (spread across map):

            - Faction Camp Template:
              * Central structure: PAVILION_A/B/C, YURT_A-H, or TENT_A-E

            GAIA:

            - Resources near player start and faction camps
            - Terrain features separating faction territories
            - ROMAN_RUINS, RELIC for exploration rewards

            MAP DESIGN:
            - Player starts in center or corner
            - Enemy base in opposite corner (final objective)
            - Neutral faction camps spread across map (one per quadrant/region)
            - Natural barriers (rivers, forests, cliffs) separating territories
            - Roads connecting camps for easy navigation
            - Each faction territory visually distinct (terrain, decorations)

            DIPLOMACY MECHANICS - CRITICAL RULES:

            1. Quest conditions by type:
               - TRIBUTE: accumulate_attribute(quantity=X, attribute=0/3, source_player=PlayerId.ONE)
                 * attribute=0 is Food, attribute=3 is Gold
               - COMBAT: destroy_object(unit_object=enemy_leader.reference_id)
               - FETCH: destroy_object(unit_object=beast.reference_id)

            2. Faction transfer uses change_ownership with area:
               - change_ownership(source_player=PlayerId.THREE, target_player=PlayerId.ONE, area_x1=..., area_y1=..., area_x2=..., area_y2=...)
               - Area should cover the entire faction camp

            3. Enemy gates owned by enemy:
               - Enemy patrols can exit through their own gates
               - Player must breach or destroy gates to attack

            4. Neutral factions start NEUTRAL:
               - Not hostile, not allied
               - Become allied after joining

            PLAYER SETUP AND BUILDINGS:

            Player ONE (Defender - Human):
            Store references for key buildings!

            Central Fortification:
            - castle = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.ONE, unit_const=BuildingInfo.CASTLE.ID, x=center, y=center)
            - OR 2x KEEP if no castle appropriate

            Walls (Player ONE owns all walls and gates):
            - 30-50 STONE_WALL segments forming complete perimeter
            - 2-4 GATE at cardinal entry points (N, S, E, W)
            - Gates owned by PLAYER ONE - enemies must destroy to enter
            - Leave NO GAPS - force enemies through gates

            Towers:
            - 6-8 GUARD_TOWER or KEEP at corners and flanking gates
            - Position towers to cover gate approaches

            Economy (inside walls):
            - TOWN_CENTER (store reference for defeat condition)
            - 4-6 HOUSE
            - MILL, LUMBER_CAMP, MINING_CAMP
            - Resource piles (gold, stone, wood) inside walls

            Military (inside walls):
            - BARRACKS, ARCHERY_RANGE, STABLE for reinforcements
            - BLACKSMITH, UNIVERSITY for upgrades
            - MONASTERY for healing

            Starting Units:
            - 15-20 military: CROSSBOWMAN on walls, MAN_AT_ARMS at gates
            - 8-12 VILLAGER for repairs and resource gathering
            - 1 Hero/Commander (optional, store reference)

            Player TWO-FOUR (Attackers - AI):
            - NO starting buildings (attackers spawn via triggers)
            - NO starting units (all created by wave triggers)
            - Define spawn points at map edges:
              * North: spawn_n_x = center, spawn_n_y = 5
              * South: spawn_s_x = center, spawn_s_y = map_size - 5
              * East: spawn_e_x = map_size - 5, spawn_e_y = center
              * West: spawn_w_x = 5, spawn_w_y = center

            GAIA:
            - Resources INSIDE defender's walls (gold, stone, wood, food)
            - Terrain features OUTSIDE channeling attackers toward gates:
              * Forests blocking flanking routes
              * Cliffs/water creating chokepoints
              * Roads leading from spawn points to gates

            GATE AND WALL MECHANICS - CRITICAL:

            1. DEFENDER owns all gates:
               - unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.ONE, unit_const=BuildingInfo.GATE_NORTH_TO_SOUTH.ID, ...)
               - Enemies CANNOT pass through - must destroy gate

            2. Walls must form COMPLETE perimeter:
               - No gaps for enemies to exploit
               - Force all attackers through gate chokepoints

            3. Siege weapons target gates:
               - Wave 3+ includes BATTERING_RAM to break gates
               - Once gate destroyed, infantry floods through

            4. Tower placement:
               - Towers covering gate approaches maximize damage
               - Crossfire zones at gates

            WAVE SPAWN LOCATIONS:
            Use different edges for variety:
            - Wave 1: North edge
            - Wave 2: East edge
            - Wave 3: South edge
            - Wave 4: ALL edges simultaneously (surround)

            DIFFICULTY SCALING:
            | Difficulty | Wave Size | Siege | Final Wave |
            |------------|-----------|-------|------------|
            | Easy       | -30%      | -50%  | No hero    |

            Player THREE+ (Secondary Defenders - AI):
            - Outposts between defensive lines
            - WATCH_TOWER + 5-10 troops each
            - Reinforce main defender when attacked

            GAIA (Capturable Equipment):
            Store references for capture triggers!
            - trebuchet = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.GAIA, unit_const=UnitInfo.TREBUCHET.ID, ...)
            - ram = unit_manager.add_unit(PlayerId.GAIA, unit_const=UnitInfo.BATTERING_RAM.ID, ...)
            - Place near walls but outside enemy reach
            - TRANSPORT_SHIP if water crossing needed

            GATE MECHANICS - CRITICAL:

            1. ALL gates owned by DEFENDER (PlayerId.TWO):
               - Defenders can patrol THROUGH their own gates
               - Reinforcements can move between defensive layers
               - Player must DESTROY gates to pass

            2. Wall weak points:
               - Mark certain wall segments as "weak" (store references)
               - These require fewer hits to destroy
               - Provides player with tactical choices

            3. Gate destruction sequence:
               - Outer gate → access to middle zone
               - Middle gate → access to inner fortress
               - Inner gate → access to castle

            4. Progressive unlocking:
               - Each gate breach triggers discovery of next layer
               - Enemies retreat to next defensive line when current falls

            MAP DESIGN:
            - Player starts at map edge
            - Three defensive layers blocking path:
              * Outer: Palisade + watchtowers (1/4 into map)
              * Middle: Stone walls + guard towers (1/2 into map)
              * Inner: Castle + keeps (3/4 into map or center)
            - GAIA siege equipment between layers (capturable)
            - Terrain channeling attacks toward gates
            - Optional flanking routes (harder but bypass some defenses)

            "story": """Create an Age of Empires 2 STORY scenario combining patterns from all campaigns:
            - Title: {title}
            - Description: {description}

            - Players: {players}
            - Difficulty: {difficulty}

            ===== MANDATORY TRIGGER REQUIREMENTS =====
            YOU MUST CREATE EXACTLY 45-60 TRIGGERS. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

            REQUIRED TRIGGER BREAKDOWN (minimum counts):
            - Setup triggers: 5-6 (Techs, difficulty, AI behavior, initial state)
            - Act 1 triggers: 10-12 (introduction, meet characters, first quest)
            - Act 2 triggers: 12-15 (rising action, complications, recruitment)
            - Act 3 triggers: 10-12 (climax, final battle, resolution)
            - Objective triggers: 5-6 using "[O] Name" pattern
            - Victory/Defeat triggers: 5-6
            ==========================================

            TRIGGER DESIGN - CRITICAL RULES:

            1. STORY PROGRESSION uses bring_object_to_area, NOT timers!
               - Player controls pacing by moving through the world
               - Each story beat triggered by reaching a location
               - Timers ONLY for opening narration and ambient dialogue

            2. Store ALL important unit references:
               - hero = unit_manager.add_unit(...) - for area triggers
               - ally = unit_manager.add_unit(...) - for death checks
               - villain = unit_manager.add_unit(...) - for victory condition

            3. Gate ownership:
               - Enemy bases: Enemy owns gates (so they can patrol/exit)
               - Player captures gates via destroy_object or change_ownership

            TRIGGER STRUCTURE (CREATE ALL OF THESE):
